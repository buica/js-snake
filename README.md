# js-snake
This is a simple snake game I wrote in order to learn how to use the Canvas API with JavaScript to draw and "animate" objects on canvas.

To run it, download the contents to a single directory on your local disk. 
Then either write out the pathname in your browser to run it (i.e. /Users/user/Downloads/js-snake/index.html), 
or manually drag the .HTML file onto the browser page.
